# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL
# Project Description
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using SQL. The dataset used is an Excel file containing details of pizza sales such as order IDs, pizza types, sizes, order dates, and order times. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and various insights such as total revenue, average order value, and pizza sales trends are derived from this data using SQL queries.

## Data
The data used for this analysis includes the following columns:

##### i. order_id: Unique identifier for each order.
##### ii. pizza_name: The name of the pizza.
##### iii. pizza_size: Size of the pizza.
##### iv. quantity: Number of pizzas ordered.
##### v. total_price: Total price of the order.
##### vi. order_date: Date when the order was placed.
##### vii. order_time: Time when the order was placed.
##### viii. pizza_category: Category the pizza belongs to (e.g., Veg, Non-Veg).

# SQL Queries Overview
The analysis is performed using various SQL queries to extract insights from the pizza sales data:

### 1. KPIs
Total Revenue: Sum of all sales from pizza orders.
Average Order Value: The average revenue per order.
Total Pizzas Sold: Total quantity of pizzas sold.
Total Orders: The number of distinct orders placed.
Average Pizzas per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order.
### 2. Trend Analysis
Daily Trend for Total Orders: Orders are grouped by day of the week to observe patterns.
Hourly Trend for Total Orders: Orders are grouped by hour to analyze peak ordering times.
### 3. Sales Breakdown
Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Proportion of total revenue generated by different pizza categories.
Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Sales percentage based on pizza sizes.
Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: Breakdown of pizzas sold by category.
Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold: Identifies the most popular pizzas.
Bottom 5 Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold: Identifies the least popular pizzas.

## Visualizations
The project includes visual analysis in the form of charts to represent trends and breakdowns:

##### i. Daily Trend for Total Orders: Orders visualized by weekday.
##### ii. Hourly Trend for Total Orders: Orders visualized by hour of the day.
##### iii. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category and Size: Visual breakdown of sales.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the pizza sales performance across various dimensions, enabling better decision-making for marketing and inventory planning.
