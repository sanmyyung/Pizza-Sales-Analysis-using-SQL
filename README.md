# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL
Project Description
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using SQL. The dataset used is an Excel file containing details of pizza sales such as order IDs, pizza types, sizes, order dates, and order times. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and various insights such as total revenue, average order value, and pizza sales trends are derived from this data using SQL queries.

order_id: Unique identifier for each order.
pizza_name: The name of the pizza.
pizza_size: Size of the pizza.
quantity: Number of pizzas ordered.
total_price: Total price of the order.
order_date: Date when the order was placed.
order_time: Time when the order was placed.
pizza_category: Category the pizza belongs to (e.g., Veg, Non-Veg).
